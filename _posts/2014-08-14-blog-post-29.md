This work illustrates the depth of insights that can be gleaned from eye movement studies, extending beyond visual cognition to encompass social cognition [(Boraston & Blakemore, 2007)](https://consensus.app/papers/application-eye‐tracking-technology-study-autism-boraston/f98442bdd9f5580ca7cf09c64845ecd8/?utm_source=chatgpt).

**Dr. A:** Glaholt and Reingold (2011) review the use of eye movement monitoring as a process tracing methodology in decision making research. They discuss how eye tracking can capture the information search behaviors of decision makers, providing a valuable tool for understanding the cognitive processes underlying decision making. This further supports the argument for the broad applicability of eye tracking in cognitive research [(Glaholt & Reingold, 2011)](https://consensus.app/papers/monitoring-process-tracing-methodology-decision-making-glaholt/b39eb66b783b5237a213fe3ff7936ee3/?utm_source=chatgpt).

**Dr. B:** Lastly, Mele and Federici (2012) emphasize the psychotechnological aspects of eye-tracking systems, advocating for a user-centric approach in the design and evaluation of eye-tracking technologies. They argue that considering the user experience in eye-tracking research can significantly enhance the utility and effectiveness of these technologies in various applications, reinforcing the importance of integrating gaze pattern modeling with user experience design [(Mele & Federici, 2012)](https://consensus.app/papers/review-eyetracking-systems-towards-experience-mele/4a6ad91531ba57f7b59c45bec583671a/?utm_source=chatgpt).
