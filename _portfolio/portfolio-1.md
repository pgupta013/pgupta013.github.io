excerpt: "The poster, titled "Investigating face pareidolia using DeepGaze: Bridging human and artificial perception" by Pranjul Gupta & Katharina Dobs from the Dept. of Psychology at Justus-Liebig University Giessen, explores the phenomenon of face pareidolia, where humans perceive familiar patterns like faces in random stimuli. Using DeepGaze, a computational model trained to predict human gaze behavior, the study examines its ability to recognize face-like patterns in various visual stimuli. The research compares DeepGaze's performance with that of the Dual Shot Face Detector (DSFD), a state-of-the-art human face detection algorithm. Findings show DeepGaze outperforms DSFD in identifying face-like patterns and exhibits a high correlation with human gaze, particularly in scenes with objects and faces, though it is less effective in face pareidolia scenes. The study underscores DeepGaze's potential as a tool for investigating complex perceptual phenomena such as face pareidolia."
