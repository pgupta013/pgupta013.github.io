![Illustration of highlighting my CV](/images/profile_pic.webp){: .align-right width="300px"}

🧠 I'm a final year Ph.D. candidate at Justus-Liebig University (JLU), Giessen, Germany, under the guidance of Dr.rer.nat. Katharina Dobs, focusing on Visual Cognition & Computational Neuroscience.

🔍 My research interests lie in exploring the boundaries between artificial and human perception, particularly in understanding how faces and objects are processed by both.

🎓 Currently, I am working towards my Ph.D. with projects on CNNs revealing the computational implausibility of the expertise hypothesis and investigating face pareidolia in deep neural networks.

💡 I am passionate about sharing knowledge and engaging with the academic community, particularly in areas of machine learning and neuroscience.

# Selected Experience

## 🛠️ Open Source Contributions
I have actively contributed to enhancing manufacturing processes through deep learning at the Fraunhofer Institute of Production Technology (IPT), Aachen, Germany, where I developed predictive tool wear models and was involved in projects optimizing cutting tools with digital image processing.

Moreover, I have shared insights into my work on automated tool cutting using the Keyence VHX-6000 series microscope and acoustic sensors for process optimization in manufacturing.

## 📖 Independent Research
My work includes implementing state-of-the-art algorithms and conducting rigorous experiments to explore visual cognition phenomena. Projects like "CNNs reveal the computational implausibility of the expertise hypothesis" and "Investigating face pareidolia using DeepGaze" underscore my capability to bridge the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical applications.

To disseminate my findings, I've engaged in various talks, posters, conferences, and workshops, including presenting at ECVP and contributing to the Perception journal.

## 🏢 Professional Experience
I am currently involved in cutting-edge research at the Visual Cognition & Computational Neuroscience Lab at JLU, focusing on projects that challenge and expand our understanding of human and artificial perception.

Previously, I gained practical experience at Tata Motors Limited, India, where I applied machine learning techniques to enhance manufacturing efficiency and process automation.

## 🌱 Teaching and Community Contributions
I actively share my knowledge and research findings through platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn, aiming to contribute to the broader scientific community's understanding of visual cognition and computational neuroscience. I plan to create, publish and share on more open-source platforms soon.
