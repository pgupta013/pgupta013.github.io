In this workshop presentation, I discussed the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to test the computational plausibility of the expertise hypothesis in visual recognition processes. The session included an in-depth analysis of how deep learning models can inform our understanding of visual cognition, emphasizing the parallels and distinctions between artificial and human perceptual capabilities.
