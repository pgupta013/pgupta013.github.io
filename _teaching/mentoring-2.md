Christine Huschens' Bachelor Thesis focuses on a study of the inversion effects in the perception of faces, pareidolias, and objects in both biological and artificial networks, employing eye-tracking and DeepGaze saliency maps for comparison. The thesis covers the phenomenon of pareidolia—the tendency to perceive faces in everyday objects—and investigates how this phenomenon and face recognition are affected when images are inverted. It explores the neural processes involved in detecting faces and pareidolias, comparing human and artificial neural network responses to these stimuli. The study aims to understand the influence of image inversion on fixation patterns in humans and artificial networks, and how context (art vs. real objects) affects these patterns.
