excerpt: "Using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), this study investigates the neural basis of face pareidolia, showing that initial misidentification of faces in inanimate objects is a byproduct of the brain's optimization for face and object recognition. The research reveals that while early stages of processing mistake pareidolia for real faces, this error is corrected in later stages through specialized face recognition optimization."
