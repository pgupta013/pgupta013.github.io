excerpt: 'This study challenges the expertise hypothesis suggesting face-specific brain mechanisms are domain-general, showing neural networks optimized for generic object categorization outperform those for face recognition in expert object discrimination. It highlights the computational implausibility of domain-general mechanisms being as effective as face-specific ones in specialized tasks.'
